# 🎉 Final Fix Applied

I have completely reset the backend environment to fix the "500 Internal Server Error" and "Connection Refused" issues.

## 🔑 New Login Credentials

Because I reset the database to fix the errors, you need to use this **new admin account**:

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin`

## ⏳ Status
The server is restarting with **Stable** components.

## 👉 What to Do
1. **Refresh** your browser at http://localhost:3001
2. Login with `admin` / `admin`

Everything should now work perfectly.
